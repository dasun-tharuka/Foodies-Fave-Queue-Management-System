The food center has exactly 50 burgers in stock. For each customer added to the queue (the name is tracked), the stock is updated. (assuming each customer is served 5 burgers), a warning message is displayed when the stock reaches a value of 10 burgers. Operators can perform the following tasks by selecting from a console menu.
